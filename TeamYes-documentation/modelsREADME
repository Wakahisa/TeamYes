This is a readme file for the models folder
Things that go in here are instructions and notes specific to the models used in this project

Especially important is any really useful custom helpers, templates, and coding conventions used

Important: anything with 'ViewModel' in it's name is a model that is used to hold other models for the prupose
of passing the data into a view. Each viewmodel should self contain any load/set methods that it needs. This 'ViewModel'
object is NOT saved to the database, it contains a collection of items from teh database.

It's up to the developer whether or not to reference by ID number or by object. If by ID number 
then we should make a universal FindById service

The Shared folder holds models that are used by multiple differene virew and controllers. The 
DataItems folder is for simple data objects that the other models use.
