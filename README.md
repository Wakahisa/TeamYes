This is a class project I worked on for Web Application Development.

A web application that allows teachers to create courses and check student progress.

August 2017 - December 2017

Description:

This web application allows instructors to create modules for students to learn programming. Each created module contains lessons, resources,
and workpages for students. This prototype is incomplete and hasn't connected the functionality between the instructor and student portion yet.
