This is a readme file for the controllers folder
Things that go in here are instructions and notes specific to the controllers used in this project

Especially important is any really useful custom helpers, templates, and coding conventions used

AdminMainController will go away at some point, currently it's purely an example

AdminController has a link for each table in the db
	links go to an action result that returns a partial view which is a list of the table rows
	editors are modal popups that dieplay an items that is to be edited
