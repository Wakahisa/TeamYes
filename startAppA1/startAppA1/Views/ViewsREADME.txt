This is a readme file for the views folder
Things that go in here are instructions and notes specific to the views used in this project

Especially important is any really useful custom helpers, templates, and coding conventions used

link rel="stylesheet" href="~/Content/argle_bargle.min.css" <-- goes in _Layout.cshtml

breadcrumbs are controlled in Mvcd.sitemap, if there are errors edit that file to correct them.

use an underscore in front of the view name to indicate a partial view
